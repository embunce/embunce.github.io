    <h2> Let the good times roll! </h2>

    <p> Picture this, you and some friends have spent your day surfing, tanning, and drinking in the sun. You don't want the day in the sun to end, but you have dinner plans that you have to go get ready for in 20 minutes. Instead of stopping the fun times, the crew decidess to ditch the dinner plans to keep hanging out, and you just eat a banana instead. Now the great day can keep on rolling, and you still got in a nutritious meal.In 2012 after a day of surfing, tanning, and drinking beers on the beach, our founders came up with this idea of the banana theory. They decided the theory needed to be shared and they launched their first beachside shack. The original location on Kapalua Bay, Maui was so successful that they were able to launch a second location in Waikiki, Oahu and a third in Mission Beach, San Diego. Now for almost 10 years we've been helping people get a quick nutritious and refreshing snack while keeping the good times rolling. And that, my friends, is the banana theory. </p>
